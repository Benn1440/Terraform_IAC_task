# Terraform Infrastructure as Code with AWS

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure-as-code software tool created by HashiCorp. With Terraform we can automate Infrastructure to provision and manage resources in any cloud or data center.

For this project, an AWS IAM User was created with Administrator access.

On Visual Studio code there was the need to install the AWS Toolkits and Terraform extension, and after that login with the already generated Access key ID & Secret access key.

Which generated various AWS resource Templates in our selected Region.

# AWS Providers

Terraform uses a provider to interface with the Application Programming Interface (API) of any infrastructure you are trying to build available to the cloud service provider. ## https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs
